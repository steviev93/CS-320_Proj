Portfolio project for testing class

How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

I ensure that my code is functional by means of test-driven development. Here, I have developed tests that verify all code works as intended, as per a requirements
sheet given to us at the start of the class. I used appropriate, efficient data structures where needed and created classes that follow the single responsibility principle.
I ensure that my code is secure by making sure necessary restrictions on class attributes are set (such as IDs being unmodifiable), and by using the appropriate
access modifiers.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

I went through the aforementioned requirements document, taking note of all of the individual classes that would need to be represented in the code, along with
their required attributes. I then made sure that all restrictions that needed to be set were defined, and finally, made sure that the service classes were 
equiped with all of the necessary functionality. I then ran unit tests with coverage to ensure that the code worked as intended.

How do I approach designing software?

My approach to designing software is heavily based in OOP, where I determine classes/objects that will need to be defined in the software first. I do this by
combing through the requirements and identifying any nouns that could represent such objects, along with the necessary attributes attached to each class. 
Proceeding through the requirements, I then ensure that all of the interactions between objects and functionality is included. I then utilize testing software,
such as JUnit or xUnit, to ensure that the software works as intended, and lastly (if applicable), run the software to see how my own experience is with it.
This last step is a role playing attempt to ensure that if I were the user, I would have an optimal experience. I then give it to peers for the same verification.
